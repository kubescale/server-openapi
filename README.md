# server-swagger
Swagger specification of the [Kubescale](https://github.com/kubescale) and [Tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale) server interface.

[The Specification](https://kubescale.github.io/server-openapi/)


## Disclaimer
This repository and Kubescale is currently being developed and maintained by TCorp BV, a for-profit company that is currently not associated with Tailscale.

## Contributing
Currently the specification is very incomplete (and likely also wrong). All contributions are thus extremely appreciated! I'm also open to moving this to [github.com/tailscale](https://github.com/tailscale) if the Tailscale team is interested in that.

Once your contribution is merged, it should be visible on the Github page within minutes. If not, please clear your cookies and cache for the website.
